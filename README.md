# The-mysterious-number
I am thinking of a three-digit number. The hundreds digit is odd, the tens digit is even, and the units digit is odd as well. The number is not divisible by 3. What is the number I am thinking of?

Solution 2: The number is 159. It meets all the conditions mentioned in the puzzle: the hundreds digit is odd (1), the tens digit is even (5), and the units digit is odd (9). It is also not divisible by 3 since the sum of its digits (1 + 5 + 9) is not divisible by 3.
